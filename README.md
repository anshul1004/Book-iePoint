A book records management system by the book owner

A book store uses a personal computer to maintain the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop.
The list includes details such as author, title, price, publisher, stock position etc.

Whenever a customer wants a book, the shopkeeper inputs the title and author of the book and the system replies whether the book is in the list or not.
If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed.
If the book is in the list, the system displays the book details and asks for number of copies. 
If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the books is displayed, otherwise an appropriate message is displayed.

More tasks include:
1. Adding new stock
2. Deleting the existing stock
3. Searching for a particular book

The project is implemented in Django where the book owner performs appropriate tasks on the web browser interface.
